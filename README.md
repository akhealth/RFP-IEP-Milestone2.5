## Important note about referenced documentation

You'll notice that we link to a number of working documents in our RFP and related materials.  Interested vendors should be aware that all of these documents are subject to change because Alaska is continuing to learn more as we continue prototyping and working with various elements of the existing system to build out our DevSecOps capabilities.  In addition to paying close attention to this repository, we encourage interested vendors to "Watch" what's going on in [the DPA Eligibility Modernization repo](https://github.com/akhealth/EIS-Modernization).  We don't anticipate anything that we learn or change in this environment to alter how an interested vendor would staff up their proposed teams.  As discussed throughout the RFP, we are interested in vendors that are open to such changes without requiring a static set of requirements at the time of the RFP.

## Background

The Division of Public Assistance (DPA) works closely with federal partners—including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), and the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)—to implement federal regulations and program requirements.
To fulfill these responsibilities, DPA relies on several technical systems:
- Eligibility Information System (EIS): A legacy mainframe system supporting eligibility determination and benefit administration for multiple public assistance programs.
- Alaska’s Resource for Integrated Eligibility Services (ARIES): A modern system supporting Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Medicaid eligibility and administration. ARIES is a core component of Alaska’s Integrated Eligibility Platform (IEP) and provides the foundation for expanding modernized eligibility services across all public assistance programs.

The first product increments were improvements to the worker experience in the ARIES system, in addition to stabilizing the underlying infrastructure; this was Milestone 1 on our modernization roadmap. 

Milestone 2, Increments 1-5 of our modernization roadmap, we will be developing the product features needed to support eligibility determination and benefit administration for the remaining non-MAGI Medicaid categories and hospital presumptive eligibility. This procurement/acquisition is complete; the project began in October 2025. Specific information regarding this procurement can be found in the [RFP-IES-Milestone2 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/akhealth/RFP-IES-Milestone2) (make sure to add yourself as a watcher to receive updates).

This Request for Proposal (RFP) is seeking a vendor to develop and support the efforts within Milestone 2.5 on the modernization roadmap. The objective of Milestone 2.5 is to migrate and convert the mainframe data and reports that are associated with Milestones 2 and 3, into a modern data repository that is accessible via API to all consumers. Specifically, this project will migrate and convert beneficiary data, and related operational and administrative reports for the non-MAGI Medicaid programs and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

### How to respond or ask questions

We've made every effort to allow for less burden in what we require from interested vendors. Although the RFP might seem to be pretty extensive, we're asking for questions that will better enable us to clarify parts of this RFP that might be unclear. please use the built in [GitHub Q/A](https://github.com/akhealth/RFP-IEP-Milestone2.5/issues) to ask questions, make suggestions, or provide feedback. We intend to review feedback and make RFP amendments and updates as needed.

### Budget

We estimate a budget of $5,000,000.00 dollars for the completion of this project as outlined in the RFP. Proposals priced at more than this amount will be considered non-responsive.  This will be a time and materials contract.

### Contract Term

This contract term is planned to be approximately 18 months.
