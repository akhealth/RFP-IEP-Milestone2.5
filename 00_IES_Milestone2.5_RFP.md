# Section 2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

[47.05.010](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/statutes.asp#47.05.010)
designates Department of Health (DOH), Division of Public Assistance
(DPA) as having responsibility for determining eligibility and
administration of Alaska’s public assistance programs. As a part of this
designation, DPA is charged with determining eligibility for each of the
programs based on state and federal regulation, governed by Alaska
Administrative Code, [Title
7](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/aac.asp#1.05). Our mission is to “promote
self-sufficiency and provide basic living expenses to Alaskans in need.”

Alaska’s public assistance programs:
- Adult Public Assistance (APA)
- Alaska Temporary Assistance Program (ATAP)
- ATAP Work Services
- Childcare
- Chronic and Acute Medical Assistance (CAMA)
- Family Nutrition
- General Relief Assistance
- Heating Assistance
- Interim Assistance
- Medicaid
  - Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)
  - Denali KidCare (SCHIP)
  - Aged, Disabled, Blind, and Long-Term Care
- Permanent Fund Dividend Hold-Harmless
- Senior Benefits
- Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (aka food stamps)
- SNAP Employment and Training
- Tribal Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
- Women, Infants, and Children Program (WIC)

The Division of Public Assistance (DPA) works closely with federal partners—including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), and the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)—to implement federal regulations and program requirements.
To fulfill these responsibilities, DPA relies on several technical systems:

- Eligibility Information System (EIS): A legacy mainframe system supporting eligibility determination and benefit administration for multiple public assistance programs.
- Alaska’s Resource for Integrated Eligibility Services (ARIES): A modern system supporting Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Medicaid eligibility and administration. ARIES is a core component of Alaska’s Integrated Eligibility Platform (IEP) and provides the foundation for expanding modernized eligibility services across all public assistance programs.

**Eligibility Information System (EIS)**

While EIS has effectively supported program administration and benefit delivery for over 40 years, the technology on which it is based (IBM mainframe platform, COBOL software development language and ADABAS database management system) is becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain. Many significant changes in public assistance programs and program administration have occurred since the system was placed into production in 1984. Mandatory federal Medicaid provisions of the ACA, Welfare Reform, new program demands, and the continued growth and complexity in public assistance programs are creating a shift in business needs. The system is currently functioning well beyond the capacity for which it was designed and does not provide the flexibility needed to implement mandatory federal provisions. 
A key objective for the State of Alaska is to de-commission the EIS system as soon as possible; DPA has developed an Eligibility Modernization Roadmap to plan for and support this objective.

**Alaska’s Resource for Integrated Eligibility Services (ARIES)**

Alaska’s Resource for Integrated Eligibility Services (ARIES) is hosted in the Azure Commercial Cloud and built on a modern, scalable framework. Originally implemented to support eligibility determination and benefit administration for MAGI Medicaid, ARIES now serves as the cornerstone of Alaska’s Integrated Eligibility Platform (IEP).
The system is actively used by more than 400 Division of Public Assistance (DPA) staff, including eligibility technicians, administrative personnel, and management. In addition, ARIES supports access for multiple contractors and community partners who assist with public assistance program administration. Altogether, the system supports over 700 users and manages eligibility and benefits for more than 200,000 recipients.
DPA is currently working to de-couple and extend ARIES through the use of microservices, enabling the platform to support eligibility determination and benefit administration for additional public assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

**Integrated Eligibility Platform (IEP)**

DPA is developing a modern, Integrated Eligibility Platform (IEP) that enables staff to more efficiently issue correct and timely benefits to Alaskans who need help meeting their basic needs. While the IEP encompasses several systems, each with a specific purpose, the ARIES system is the cornerstone. DPA intends to leverage and extend the ARIES system to develop a fully Integrated Eligibility Platform (IEP), that supports eligibility determination and benefit administration for all public assistance programs, as well as integration/interoperability across the systems within the integrated eligibility platform.

![The Architecture](media/iep_architecture.png)

Utilizing agile development methods and modular procurements, DPA has the goal of implementing an eligibility system that not only meets state and federal standards, but is user friendly for clients, eligibility staff, and technical staff.
DPA has moved away from a "big bang" waterfall acquisitions process to a more modular approach, emphasizing user centered design, agile product development, and DevSecOps practices. We integrate user experience, security, and privacy into all our development work. More information about the Alaska E&E Modernization project can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/Akhealth/EIS-Modernization) (be sure to add yourself as a watcher on the overall eligibility modernization repository to automatically get updates about changes and upcoming procurements). The goal of this approach is twofold: 
- Persistently deliver measurable and sustainable incremental improvements to the IEP
- Migrate the remaining public assistance programs off the legacy EIS mainframe system and onto the new Integrated Eligibility platform (ARIES/IEP)
Offerors should review this repository for information that will be critical in constructing a quality proposal. Of specific interest are:

Strategy](https://github.com/akhealth/EIS-Modernization/blob/master/tech-strategy.md)

To ensure ongoing progress towards meeting DPA roadmap goals, this approach involves organizing product teams to focus on individual procurements and product increments. These teams work together with the selected vendor to complete work organized by regular sprints. These sprints encompass activities such as daily or regular standups, end-of-sprint retrospectives, sprint reviews of completed work, sprint planning, and backlog grooming sessions.
Our Eligibility Modernization Roadmap – Milestones – found [here](https://github.com/Akhealth/EIS-Modernization/) map out DPA migration strategy to move the remaining programs out of the EIS mainframe system and into a modern modular software and platform with architecture based on open Application Programming Interface (API) data standardization. Each Milestone is a separate procurement/project.
The first product increments were improvements to the worker experience in the ARIES system, in addition to stabilizing the underlying infrastructure; this was Milestone 1 on our modernization roadmap. 
Milestone 2, Increments 1-5 of our modernization roadmap, we will be developing the product features needed to support eligibility determination and benefit administration for the remaining non-MAGI Medicaid categories and hospital presumptive eligibility. This procurement/acquisition is complete; the project began in October 2025. Specific information regarding this procurement can be found in the [RFP-IES-Milestone2 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/akhealth/RFP-IES-Milestone2) (**make sure to add yourself as a watcher to receive updates**).
This Request for Proposal (RFP) is seeking a vendor to develop and support the efforts within Milestone 2.5 on the modernization roadmap. The objective of Milestone 2.5 is to migrate and convert the mainframe data and reports that are associated with Milestones 2 and 3, into a modern data repository that is accessible via API to all consumers. Specifically, this project will migrate and convert beneficiary data, and related operational and administrative reports for the non-MAGI Medicaid programs and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).; Additional information is provided in [Sec. 3.01 Scope of Work](#sec-301-scope-of-work).

## Sec. 2.01 Program Information

As stated above, the Department of Health (DOH) is the state agency designated to administer the Alaska Medicaid and SNAP programs, which include:
- Medicaid
- Denali KidCare 
- Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

The Division of Public Assistance (DPA) is responsible for determining the eligibility of individuals and families in need of Medicaid benefits.
DPA administers the Medicaid program in accordance with Federal and State laws and regulations. The Medicaid program is authorized under Title XIX and Title XXI of the Social Security Act and the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 42 Part 435 and Title 45 Part 233. Alaska’s Medicaid State Plan may be viewed [here](https://health.alaska.gov/Commissioner/Pages/MedicaidStatePlan/default.aspx)
Alaska joined the Medicaid program in September 1972. The state Legislature has added new services and eligible groups to the Medicaid program since that time. The Medicaid program in Alaska is authorized under Alaska Statutes 47.07.010 - 47.07.900 and the Alaska Administrative Code, Title 7 Chapter 43 and Chapter 100.

Additional program details are provided in [Attachment 09](https://github.com/akhealth/RFP-IEP-Milestone2.5/blob/main/09%20BAA.pdf)

## Sec. 2.02 Outcomes and Measures

CMS-required outcomes for Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES) are the standard requirements for certification based on federal regulations and statutes. These outcomes establish a baseline for the functionality of a system or module, which is required to continue receiving federal funding for operations. CMS-required outcomes also demonstrate that a system complies with applicable federal regulations. For supporting detail on specific CMS Outcomes, please refer to [Attachment 08](https://github.com/akhealth/RFP-IEP-Milestone2.5/blob/main/08%20CMS%20Required%20Outcomes.pdf).

While the CMS Required Outcomes are not within the direct scope of this RFP, the contractor must ensure the metric data DPA uses to measure these required outcomes remains intact (or alternate metrics are defined based upon the converted/migrated data).

**State Based Outcomes**

- Modernized Data Infrastructure: The legacy Eligibility Information System (EIS) data will be successfully migrated to a secure, cloud-based data repository in Microsoft Azure, enabling real-time access and interoperability with existing systems, especially with the new Integrated Eligibility Platform (IEP) for all public assistance programs
- Improved Eligibility Determination and Benefit Administration: The new data integration solution will support accurate and timely eligibility determinations and benefit issuance for non-MAGI Medicaid and SNAP programs, in compliance with federal and state regulations
- Enhanced Reporting and Analytics Capabilities: A separate, but integrated data lake/warehouse will be implemented to support advanced analytics, business intelligence, and secure, role-based access. This analytics system will be built in Azure and utilize industry standard data modeling methodologies appropriate for the system’s purpose, improving operational oversight and decision-making. 
- Compliance with Federal Certification Standards: The solution will meet all CMS-required outcomes and security standards (including MARS-E 2.2 and ARC-AMPE Framework), ensuring continued federal funding and authorization to operate
- Sustainable Agile Development and Documentation: The project will follow agile development practices with continuous delivery, automated documentation, and modular design, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and ease of future integration

In addition, the contractor will deliver structured training sessions and hands-on knowledge transfer to Alaska Department of Health staff to ensure internal capacity for ongoing system operation, enhancement, and troubleshooting.
The Alaska Department of Health considers these outcomes to be critical to the overall implementation success of this product. The outcomes will be documented, measured, and reported throughout the life of this contract and beyond.

## Sec. 2.03 Current Architecture

Below is information describing the current mix of systems that are used to determine public assistance program eligibility and administer benefits. The overall modernization strategy for the public assistance system is contained in the [DOH GitHub Repository](https://github.com/akhealth/EIS-Modernization). The following is for reference only and connects to the scope of work described in [Sc. 3.01 Scope of Work](#sec-301-scope-of-work).

**Eligibility Information System (EIS)**

EIS is an “Adaptable Data Base System” (ADABAS) database system which resides in a mainframe environment. The database serves two separate programs: EIS and the Case Management System (CMS). Consequently, certain data files are shared between the systems.
EIS runs batch jobs to perform tasks in the following general categories:
- Interface batch jobs
- Reports batch jobs
- Notices batch jobs
- Alerts batch jobs
- Issuance batch jobs
- Database Maintenance batch jobs and
- Other batch jobs

EIS interfaces with the following systems:
- Social Security Administration (SSA) Beneficiary Data Exchange (BENDEX)

# Section 5. EVALUATION CRITERIA AND CONTRACTOR SELECTION

## Sec. 5.01 Summary of Evaluation Process

The state will use the following steps to evaluate and prioritize proposals:

1\)	Proposals will be assessed for overall responsiveness. Proposals deemed non-responsive will be eliminated from further consideration. 
2\)	A proposal evaluation committee (PEC), made up of at least three state employees or public officials, will evaluate specific parts of the responsive proposals.
3\)	The Submittal Forms, from each responsive proposal, will be sent to the PEC. No cost information will be shared or provided to the PEC.
4\)	The PEC will independently evaluate and score the documents based on the degree to which they meet the stated evaluation criteria.
5\)	After independent scoring, the PEC will have a meeting, chaired by the procurement officer, where the PEC may have a group discussion prior to finalizing their scores. 
6\)	The evaluators will submit their final individual scores to the procurement officer, who will then compile the scores and calculate awarded points as set out in [Sec. 5.03 Scoring Method and Calculation](#sec-503-scoring-method-and-calculation).
7\)	The procurement officer will calculate scores for cost proposals as set out in [Sec. 5.07 Contract Cost (Cost Proposal)](#sec-507-contract-cost-cost-proposal) and add those scores to the awarded points.
8\)	The procurement officer may prioritize the proposals, and the state may conduct interviews with the top-rated offerors.
9\)	The PEC will evaluate and score the interviews, and the procurement officer will compile the final scores.
10\) The state may then conduct contract negotiations with the most advantageous offeror and award a contract if the negotiations are successful. 

## Sec. 5.02 Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on their overall value to state, considering both cost and non-cost factors as described below. Note: An evaluation may not be based on discrimination due to the race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, marital status, pregnancy, parenthood, disability, or political affiliation of the offeror.

**TOTAL EVALUATION POINTS AVAILABLE: 1000**

## Sec. 5.03 Scoring Method and Calculation

The PEC will evaluate responses against the questions set out in SEC. 4.04 through 4.07 and assign a single score for each section. Offerors’ responses for each section may be rated comparatively against one another with each PEC member assigning a score of 1, 5, or 10 (with 10 representing the highest score, 5 representing the average score, and 1 representing the lowest score). Responses that are similar or lack dominant information to differentiate the offerors from each other will receive the same score. Therefore, it is the offeror’s responsibility to provide dominant information and differentiate themselves from their competitors.
After the PEC has scored each section, the scores for each section will be totaled and the following formula will be used to calculate the points awarded for that section:
1\)	Maximum Points Available / Maximum Combined PEC Score Possible
2\)	Combined PEC Score x Result of 1)	

**Example (Maximum Points Available for the Section = 100):**

| **Offeror**   | **PEC Member 1 Score** | **PEC Member 2 Score** | **PEC Member 3 Score** | **PEC Member 4 Score** | **Combined Total Score** | **Points Awarded** |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Offeror 1     | 10                     | 5                      | 5                      | 10                     | 30                       | 75                 |
| Offeror 2     | 5                      | 5                      | 5                      | 5                      | 20                       | 50                 |
| Offeror 3     | 10                     | 10                     | 10                     | 10                     | 40                       | 100                |


**Offeror 1** was awarded 75 points:

Maximum Points Available (100)

                                        =   2.5

Maximum Combined PEC Score Possible (40)

Combined PEC Score (30) x 2.5 = Points Awarded (75)

**Offeror 2** was awarded 50 points:

Maximum Points Available (100)

                                        =   2.5

Maximum Combined PEC Score Possible (40)

Combined PEC Score (20) x 2.5 = Points Awarded (50)

**Offeror 3** was awarded 100 points:

Maximum Points Available (100)

                                        =   2.5

Maximum Combined PEC Score Possible (40)

Combined PEC Score (40) x 2.5 = Points Awarded (100)
		
## Sec. 5.04 Experience and Qualifications 

This portion of the offeror’s proposal will be evaluated based on the information required in [Sec. 3.04 Transition Requirements](#sec-304-transition-requirements) of this RFP and the level of experience it demonstrates. 
The State will evaluate the proposed staffing model, skill levels, labor categories, allocation, and relevant work experience demonstrated by Key Personnel including the following:
- Experience in performing work of similar scope and complexity
- Experience with similar technology, software development and related development methodology, human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods

## Sec. 5.05 Technical Understanding and Approach

The State will evaluate the offeror’s technical approach, focusing on the level of knowledge, technical expertise, and overall understanding of the requirements. The State will also consider the offeror’s skills with similar technology, software development, and continuous deployment methods. Of special note is how well the proposed approach aligns with the [Department’s Technical Strategy](https://github.com/akhealth/EIS-Modernization/blob/master/tech-strategy.md).
Key points to include:
- Technical Expertise and Knowledge:
	- Experience with similar projects: describe previous projects that are similar in scope and complexity to the current RFP. Highlight specific technologies, methodologies, and tools used
	- Understanding of project requirements: demonstrate a thorough understanding of the project requirements outlined in Section 3.01 and Section 3.04. Explain how your team’s expertise aligns with these requirements
- Proposed Plans:
	- Adherence to technical requirements: provide a plan on how you will adhere to the technical requirements and standards listed in [Attachment 2](https://github.com/akhealth/RFP-IEP-Milestone2.5/blob/main/01%20Submittal%20Forms%20A-F.docx)
	- Implementation Strategy: outline your approach to implementing the project, including key milestones, timelines, and deliverables. Describe the processes and practices that will be used to ensure successful project execution
- Technical Risks and Opportunities:
	- Risk identification and mitigation: identify potential technical risks associated with the project and provide strategies for mitigating these risks. Discuss how you will proactively address challenges to ensure project success
	- Opportunities for Innovation: highlight any opportunities for innovation within the project. Explain how your team plans to leverage new technologies, methodologies, or practices to enhance project outcomes
- Collaboration and Communication:
	- Team coordination: describe how your team will coordinate and communicate effectively throughout the project. Include details on team structure, roles, and responsibilities
	- Stakeholder engagement: explain how you will engage with stakeholders to ensure their needs and expectations are met. Discuss your approach to managing stakeholder relationships and communication
- Quality Assurance and Testing:
	- Quality assurance management strategy: provide an overview of your quality assurance management strategy, including methods for ensuring the quality and reliability of deliverables. Describe how you will monitor and evaluate project performance
	- Testing strategy: detail your testing strategy, including types of tests to be conducted, testing environments, and methodologies. Explain how you will ensure comprehensive test coverage and defect management
- Documentation and Reporting:
	- System documentation: outline your approach to creating and maintaining system documentation. Include details on the types of documentation to be produced and how it will be kept up to date

## Sec. 5.06 Product Management Approach

The State will evaluate the offeror’s approach to project coordination, risk management, issue management, user testing, and research coordination.

## Sec. 5.07 Contract Cost (Cost Proposal)

Overall, a minimum of 25% of the total evaluation points will be assigned to cost. The offeror with the lowest total cost will receive the maximum number of points allocated to cost per 2 AAC 12.260(c). The point allocations for cost on the other proposals will be determined using the following formula:

*\[(Price of Lowest Cost Proposal) x (Maximum Points for Cost)\] ÷ (Cost
of Each Higher Priced Proposal)*

**Example (Max Points for Contract Cost = 400):**

**Step 1**
List all proposal prices, adjusted where appropriate by the application of applicable preferences claimed by the offeror.
Offeror \#1 \$40,000  
Offeror \#2 \$42,750  
Offeror \#3 \$47,500

**Step 2**

In this example, the RFP allotted 25% of the available 1,000 points to cost. This means that the lowest cost will receive the maximum number of points.

**Offeror \#1 receives 250 points.**

The reason they receive that amount is because the lowest cost proposal, in this case $40,000, receives the maximum number of points allocated to cost, 250 points.

**Offeror \#2 receives 233.9 points.**

*\$40,000 lowest cost x 250 maximum points for cost = 10,000,000 ÷ \$42,750 cost of Offeror \#2’s proposal = **233.9**

**Offeror \#3 receives 210.5 points.**

*\$40,000 lowest cost x 400 maximum points for cost = 10,000,000 ÷ \$47,500 cost of Offeror \#3’s proposal = **210.5**

## Sec. 5.08 Shortlisting

After proposals have been prioritized, the state may shortlist and interview the top three highest ranking offerors. The state may increase or decrease the number of offerors in this list based on the competitiveness of the proposals and/or from feedback from the PEC.

## Sec. 5.09 Interviews of Critical Team Members

The state may conduct an interview with the proposed key personnel along with the critical team members identified in Submittal Form A of the offeror’s proposal (the state reserves the right to request additional personnel). All these personnel must attend the interview, and no other individuals from the offeror’s organization will be allowed to sit in or participate during the interview sessions. If any of these personnel fail to attend the interview the offeror may be given a “1” score, which may jeopardize the offeror’s competitiveness.

Interviews are expected to last approximately 90 minutes, but that time may be increased or decreased at the discretion of the state. Interviewees may not bring notes, presentation materials, or handouts. Interviewees may be prohibited from making any reference to their proposed cost/fees.
Below is an example of the schedule the interviews will follow:
No.	Agenda Item	Time Allocated

| **No.** | **Agenda Item** | **Time Allocated**      |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 1       | Introductions   | Approximately 5 minutes |
| 2       | Open Session    | 90 minutes              |
| 3       | Closing Remarks | 5 minutes               |

Introductions will be used solely to introduce team member’s names and roles on both the State and the offeror’s teams. Time for introductions will not be allocated to business development purposes.
During the open technical session, the offeror will respond to the State’s questions regarding the technical aspects of their proposal. A demonstration of code management processes, where multiple teams work on a single code base including tools, testing, and process control, is particularly valuable. 

**Demonstrations**

A brief demonstration of a similar application/database built on comparable technology is permitted, or a proposed COTS, or SaaS product. If a production application/database is not available for demo, a working prototype may be presented. 
The goal of this session is to assess the abilities and understanding of the proposed Key Personnel and to further elaborate on the proposed approach described in the written proposal. 
The State is not interested in a demo or overview of an eligibility system that does not share similar technology and does not demonstrate the team’s ability to modify and maintain the State of Alaska’s Integrated Eligibility Platform. Currently, the State of Alaska is not interested in a full system replacement and does not intend to issue an RFP to do so.
The proposed Key Personnel must participate in the verbal presentation. Otherwise, the offeror will be considered non-responsive and excluded from further consideration. The State is most interested in hearing from staff who will have a direct role in completing the tasks.
Verbal presentations will take place via Microsoft Teams video chat. The State will coordinate and set up the meeting accordingly. We strongly encourage you to join with audio, video, and screen sharing capability.
The open session will not exceed 90 minutes. The Procurement Officer will strictly enforce this time limit on all presentations.
There will be no follow-up session for further questions after the presentation.
Interviewees may be asked questions regarding their experience, knowledge and understanding of the scope of work, obstacles and challenges, strategies, and their plan/approach. The state may request additional information prior to interviews. The PEC will score each interview individually using the 1, 5, 10 scoring method described in [Sec. 5.03 Scoring Method and Calculation](#sec-503-scoring-method-and-calculation) and may have a group discussion prior to finalizing scores.

## Sec. 5.10 Cost Reasonableness

Prior to entering into contract negotiations, the procurement officer may perform a ‘cost reasonable’ assessment of all shortlisted proposals in the following manner:
- If the highest ranked offeror’s cost proposal is within 5% of the next highest ranked offeror’s cost proposal, the state will proceed to invite the highest ranked offeror to contract negotiations.
- If the highest ranked offeror’s cost proposal is 5% or more (higher) than the next highest ranked offeror’s cost proposal, the state reserves the right to invite the second highest ranked offeror to contract negotiations.

## Sec. 5.11 Contract Negotiations

After final evaluation, the procurement officer may negotiate with the offeror of the highest-ranked proposal. Negotiations, if held, shall be within the scope of the request for proposals and limited to those items which would not have an effect on the ranking of proposals. 
If the selected offeror:
- fails to provide the information required to begin negotiations in a timely manner; or
- fails to negotiate in good faith; or
- indicates they cannot perform the contract within the budgeted funds available for the project; or
- if the offeror and the state, after a good faith effort, simply cannot come to terms,
The state may terminate negotiations with the offeror initially selected and commence negotiations with the next highest ranked offeror.

## Sec. 5.12 Offeror Notification of Selection

After the completion of contract negotiation, the procurement officer will issue a written Notice of Intent to Award and send copies of that notice to all offerors who submitted proposals. The notice will list the names of all offerors and identify the offeror selected for the award.
 
# SECTION 6. GENERAL PROCESS AND LEGAL INFORMATION

## SEC. 6.01 Standard Contract Provisions

The contractor will be required to sign the state's Standard Agreement Form for Professional Services. This form is [Attachment 04](https://github.com/akhealth/RFP-IEP-Milestone2.5/blob/main/04%20Standard%20Agreement%20Form%20-%20Appendices%20A%20through%20F.pdf) and attached with the RFP for your review. The contractor must comply with the Appendix A contract provisions set out in this attachment. No alteration of these provisions will be permitted without prior written approval from the Department of Law, and the state reserves the right to reject a proposal that is non-compliant or takes exception with the contract terms and conditions stated in the Agreement. Any requests to change language in this document (adjust, modify, add, delete, etc.), must be set out in the offeror’s proposal in a separate document. Please include the following information with any change that is proposed:
1\)	Identify the provision that the offeror takes exception with.
2\)	Identify why the provision is unjust, unreasonable, etc.
3\)	Identify exactly what suggested changes should be made.

## Sec. 6.02 Business Associate Agreement (BAA)

The State has a standard BAA that is included in IT-related contracts that involve Personal Health Information (PHI) covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Act. This BAA will be included in the fully executed contract and is attached along with this RFP as HIPAA BAA. Any request to change language in Section 1 of this document must be set out in the offeror’s proposal in a separate document. Any changes must be approved by the DOH Security Office and the Department of Law.
To further ensure the State meets its legal obligations regarding Protected Health Information and other confidential information, the BAA contains another section (Section 2) titled Department of Health HIPAA and HITECH Information Security Agreement (ISA). Note that ISA section is non-negotiable and if there is any conflict between the ISA section and the BAA section, the ISA prevails. Agreement with the ISA provisions is also required in order for the contractor pass the security assessment process indicated in Section 3.04.

## Sec. 6.03 Qualified Offerers

Per 2 AAC 12.875, unless provided for otherwise in the RFP, to qualify as an offeror for award of a contract issued under AS 36.30, the offeror must:
1\)	Add value in the contract by actually performing, controlling, managing, or supervising the services to be provided; or
2\)	Be in the business of selling and have actually sold on a regular basis the supplies that are the subject of the RFP

If the offeror leases services or supplies or acts as a broker or agency in providing the services or supplies in order to meet these requirements, the procurement officer may not accept the offeror as a qualified offeror under AS 36.30.

## Sec. 6.04 Proposal as Part of the Contract

Part of all of this RFP and the successful proposal may be incorporated into the contract.

## Sec. 6.05 Additional Terms and Conditions 
The state reserves the right to add terms and conditions during contract negotiations. These terms and conditions will be within the scope of the RFP and will not affect the proposal evaluations.

## Sec. 6.06 Human Trafficking

By signature on their proposal, the offeror certifies that the offeror is not established and headquartered or incorporated and headquartered in a country recognized as Tier 3 in the most recent United States Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report. 
The most recent United States Department of State’s Trafficking in
Persons Report can be found at the following [website](https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/).

Failure to comply with this requirement will cause the state to reject the proposal as non-responsive or cancel the contract.

## Sec. 6.07 Right of Rejection

Offerors must comply with all of the terms of the RFP, the State Procurement Code (AS 36.30), and all applicable local, state, and federal laws, codes, and regulations. The procurement officer may reject any proposal that does not comply with all of the material and substantial terms, conditions, and performance requirements of the RFP.
Offerors may not qualify the proposal nor restrict the rights of the state. If an offeror does so, the procurement officer may determine the proposal to be a non-responsive counteroffer, and the proposal may be rejected.

Minor informalities that:
- do not affect responsiveness
- are merely a matter of form or format
- do not change the relative standing or otherwise prejudice other offers
- do not change the meaning or scope of the RFP
- are trivial, negligible, or immaterial in nature
- do not reflect a material change in the work
- do not constitute a substantial reservation against a requirement or provision may be waived by the procurement officer

The state reserves the right to refrain from making an award if it determines that to be in its best interest. A proposal from a debarred or suspended offeror shall be rejected.

## Sec. 6.08 State Not Responsible for Preparation Costs

The state will not pay any cost associated with the preparation, submittal, presentation, or evaluation of any proposal.

## Sec. 6.09 Disclosure of Proposal Contents

All proposals and other material submitted become the property of the State of Alaska and may be returned only at the state's option. AS 40.25.110 requires public records to be open to reasonable inspection. All proposal information, including detailed price and cost information, will be held in confidence during the evaluation process and prior to the time a Notice of Intent to Award is issued. Thereafter, proposals will become public information.

Trade secrets and other proprietary data contained in proposals may be held confidential if the offeror requests, in writing, that the procurement officer does so, and if the procurement officer agrees, in writing, to do so. The offeror’s request must be included with the proposal, must clearly identify the information they wish to be held confidential, and include a statement that sets out the reasons for confidentiality. Unless the procurement officer agrees in writing to hold the requested information confidential, that information will also become public after the Notice of Intent to Award is issued.

## Sec. 6.10 Assignment

Per 2 AAC 12.480, the contractor may not transfer or assign any portion of the contract without prior written approval from the procurement officer.

## Sec. 6.11 Severability

If any provision of the contract or agreement is declared by a court to be illegal or in conflict with any law, the validity of the remaining terms and provisions will not be affected; and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced as if the contract did not contain the particular provision held to be invalid.

## Sec. 6.12 Supplemental Terms and Conditions

Proposals must comply with [Sec. 6.07 Right of Rejection](#sec-607-right-of-rejection). However, if the state fails to identify or detect supplemental terms or conditions that conflict with those contained in this RFP or that diminish the state's rights under any contract resulting from the RFP, the term(s) or condition(s) will be considered null and void. After the award of the contract:
If conflict arises between a supplemental term or condition included in the proposal and a term or condition of the RFP, the term or condition of the RFP will prevail; and
If the state's rights would be diminished as a result of application of a supplemental term or condition included in the proposal, the supplemental term or condition will be considered null and void.

## Sec. 6.13 Solicitation Advertising

Public notice has been provided in accordance with 2 AAC 12.220.

## Sec. 6.14 Clarification of Offers

Prior to the contract negotiation period detailed in [Sec. 5.11 Contract Negotiations](#sec-511-contract-negotitations), to determine if a proposal is reasonably susceptible for award, communications by the procurement officer or the proposal evaluation committee (PEC) are permitted with an offeror to clarify uncertainties or eliminate confusion concerning the contents of a proposal. Clarifications may not result in a material or substantive change to the proposal. The evaluation by the procurement officer or the PEC may be adjusted as a result of a clarification under this section.

## Sec. 6.15 Discussions with Offerors

Prior to the contract negotiation period detailed in [Sec. 5.11 Contract Negotiations](#sec-511-contract-negotitations), the state may conduct discussions with offerors in accordance with AS 36.30.240 and 2 AAC 12.290. The purpose of these discussions will be to ensure full understanding of the requirements of the RFP and proposal. Discussions will be limited to specific sections of the RFP or proposal identified by the procurement officer. Discussions will only be held with offerors who have submitted a proposal deemed reasonably susceptible for the contract award by the procurement officer. Discussions, if held, will be after the initial evaluation of proposals by the procurement officer or the PEC. If modifications are made as a result of these discussions they will be put in writing. Following discussions, the procurement officer may set a time for best and final proposal submissions from those offerors with whom discussions were held. Proposals may be reevaluated after receipt of best and final proposal submissions.

If an offeror does not submit a best and final proposal or a notice of withdrawal, the offeror’s immediate previous proposal is considered the offeror’s best and final proposal.

Offerors with a disability needing accommodation should contact the procurement officer prior to the date set for discussions so that reasonable accommodation can be made. Any oral modification of a proposal must be reduced to writing by the offeror.

## Sec. 6.16 Federally Imposed Tariffs

Changes in price (increase or decrease) resulting directly from a new or updated federal tariff, excise tax, or duty, imposed after contract award may be adjusted during the contract period or before delivery into the United States via contract amendment.
- Notification of Changes: The contractor must promptly notify the procurement officer in writing of any new, increased, or decreased federal excise tax or duty that may result in either an increase or decrease in the contact price and shall take appropriate action as directed by the procurement officer.
- After-imposed or Increased Taxes and Duties: Any federal excise tax or duty for goods or services covered by this contract that was exempted or excluded on the contract award date but later imposed on the contractor during the contract period, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action may result in a price increase provided:

a\)	The tax or duty takes effect after the contract award date and isn’t otherwise addressed by the contract
b\)	The contractor warrants, in writing, that no amount of the newly imposed federal excise tax or duty or rate increase was included in the contract price, as a contingency or otherwise
- After-relieved or Decreased Taxes and Duties: The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any decrease in federal excise tax or duty for goods or services under the contract, except social security or other employment taxes, that the contractor is required to pay or bear, or does not obtain a refund of, through the contractor's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the procurement officer
- State’s Ability to Make Changes: The state reserves the right to request verification of federal excise tax or duty amounts on goods or services covered by this contract and increase or decrease the contract price accordingly
- Price Change Threshold: No adjustment shall be made to the contract price under this clause unless the amount of the adjustment exceeds \$250.

## Sec. 6.17 Protest

AS 36.30.560 provides that an interested party may protest the content of the RFP.
An interested party is defined in 2 AAC 12.990(a) (7) as "an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose economic interest might be affected substantially and directly by the issuance of a contract solicitation, the award of a contract, or the failure to award a contract."
If an interested party wishes to protest the content of a solicitation, the protest must be received, in writing, by the procurement officer at least ten days prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals.
AS 36.30.560 also provides that an interested party may protest the award of a contract or the proposed award of a contract.
If an offeror wishes to protest the award of a contract or the proposed award of a contract, the protest must be received, in writing, by the procurement officer within ten days after the date the Notice of Intent to Award the contract is issued.
A protester must have submitted a proposal in order to have sufficient standing to protest the proposed award of a contract. Protests must include the following information:
- the name, address, and telephone number of the protester
- the signature of the protester or the protester's representative
- identification of the contracting agency and the solicitation or contract at issue
- a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest including copies of relevant documents; and the form of relief requested
Protests filed by telex or telegram are not acceptable because they do not contain a signature. Fax copies containing a signature are acceptable.
The procurement officer will issue a written response to the protest. The response will set out the procurement officer's decision and contain the basis of the decision within the statutory time limit in AS 36.30.580.
